<dl>
  <dt>Image encoder</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A library/module that converts one image format to another. Not all encoders are created equal.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
    <dt>High Frequency Imagery</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Parts of an image (or the whole image) where colour and contrast change a lot from one pixel to the next. Example: a photo of a busy intersection.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
      <dt>Low Frequency Imagery</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Parts of an image (or the whole image) where colour and contrast change very little from one pixel to the next. Example: a vector logo or other image with a lot of flat colour.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
        <dt>Colour Data</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The digital information in an image that controls pixel colour. Also called chroma data.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
          <dt>Brightness Data</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The digital information in an image that controls pixel brightness.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</p>

              <li>Pick a high frequency image (e.g. a “real” photo, not a logo) and upload it to Squoosh.</li>
              <li>Zoom the image to the size it will be on the web page (and resist the urge to zoom).
                <ul>
                  <li>To account for high resolution displays, take the native size of your image and zoom out so it’s about 50% of its original size.</li>
