    <p>A mental model is how you think something will work, based on your knowledge and experience.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
    <dt>System Model</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>How something works.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
      <dt>Interaction Model</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>How to use something.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</p>

          <p>If the way something works lines up with your expectations, you‚Äôll understand how to use it. And if it doesn‚Äôt, you will struggle.</p>

            <p>Figure 1: The Rocket Switch Gearshift is an example of a good System Model but bad Interaction Model.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

            <p>In early 2006. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled over one million vehicles due to a new shifter design known as the ‚ÄúRocket Switch Gearshift‚Äù.</p>

            <p>It ratcheted through <em>park</em>, <em>reverse</em>, <em>neutral</em> and <em>drive</em> but <strong>it would return to the centre position</strong> (i.e. what most people would assume is <em>park</em>). Driver confusion led to <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2016/06/28/fiat-chrysler-gearshift-probe-anton-yelchin/86460430/">266 crashes and 68 injuries</a>, including the death of actor Anton Yelchin.</p>

            <p>It was a failure in interface design. But how did this happen?</p>

            <h2 id="system-model-vs-interaction-model">System Model vs interaction Model</h2>

            <figure>
              <p><img src="images/md/2-system-action.png" alt="System vs Interaction Models" /></p>
              <figcaption>
                <p>Figure 2: The <strong>system model</strong> is how something <em>works</em> while the <strong>interaction model</strong> is how <em>we interact</em> with that something.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

                <p>Engineers (the people who build products) usually have strong system models but they often have weak interaction models.</p>

                <p>An automotive engineer will know how a car‚Äôs engine and drive train work but they won‚Äôt necessarily understand how an average person drives their car.</p>

                <p>Conversely, the average driver prefers to be comfortable over knowledgeable.</p>

                <h2 id="the-role-of-the-designer">The Role of the designer</h2>
                <p>Designers fill the gap between the builders and the users. A great designer has strong <strong>system models</strong> <em>and</em> strong <strong>interaction models</strong>.</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>It‚Äôs a good idea for designers to learn how to code‚Ä¶ You should, at least, have coded one project from start to finish‚Ä¶ After that, you‚Äôll understand systems much better and it‚Äôll make you a better designer.</p>

                                <p>As a designer, you may get to a point where you can take full advantage of a digital interface. But, first users need to build up that knowledge.</p>

                                        <p>While this interface <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a1860056/another-fca-gear-shifter-investigated-rollaway-risk-following-crashes/">still has its problems</a>, it has faired better than the Rocket Swift Gearshift. Why is that?</p>

                                        <p>If the mental model closely matches the actual behavior of the device or interface, then people can:</p>

                                          <li>make accurate predictions;</li>
