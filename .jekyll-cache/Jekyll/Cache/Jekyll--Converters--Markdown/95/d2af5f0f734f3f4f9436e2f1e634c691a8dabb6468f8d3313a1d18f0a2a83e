            <p>There is a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.</p>

            <p>Social scientists refer to this limit as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar‚Äôs number</a>.</p>

            <p>Social network analysis studies the human social patterns in a world where we have limited cognitive resources for maintaining social ties.</p>

            <p>Studies show that a few people account for a disproportionate amount of the connectivity. These ‚Äúconnectors‚Äù maintain many weak ties to a larger collection of tighter groups with stronger ties.</p>

            <p>Scientists refer to this as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">Small World Theory of Networks</a>. We call it <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=6+degrees+of+kevin+bacon">6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>.</p>
