<p>Frontend development is unique in web because your software interacts directly with the user (the backend doesn‚Äôt have to deal with mouse clicks, for example). Knowing your user is the first step to designing intuitive and accessible applications.</p>

                <h2 id="mental-models-in-design">1. Mental Models in Design</h2>
                <p>Mental models are how your mind uses past experience to predict real-life outcomes, like unlocking your door. If the door knob was magically moved a few centimeters to the left or right, you would notice it instantly and your keys might still be in your pocket.</p>

                <p>If the world is just a little bit off, your mind has to wake up, pay attention and figure out what‚Äôs happening.</p>

                <p>In groups of 3 or 4, explore the concept of mental models in product design.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What is the problem that the Rocket Swift Gearshift was trying to solve?</li>
                  <li>Why did it fail, while the rotary dial gear shifter <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a1860056/another-fca-gear-shifter-investigated-rollaway-risk-following-crashes/">failed less</a>?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You found an example of product design in your home, office, etc (you may also find examples online):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What problem is the product trying to solve?</li>
                  <li>Describe its System Model and compare it to its Interaction Model.</li>
                  <li>Can you think of a product that has a good Interaction Model but bad System Model?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="web-conventions">2. Web Conventions</h2>
                <p>How we really use the web (source: Don‚Äôt Make Me Think, Chapter 2):</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>We don‚Äôt read pages. we scan them.</li>
                  <li>We don‚Äôt make optimal choices. We satisfice.</li>
                  <li>We don‚Äôt figure out how things work. We muddle through.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Conventions are popular design patterns that evolve over time as the user becomes more knowledgeable. Your audience will have pre-defined expectations that fall into three general categories:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Where things are located on a page. Example: login button -&gt; top right.</li>
                  <li>How things work. Example: the shopping cart metaphor.</li>
                  <li>How things look. Example: errors are red and like buttons are blue.</li>
                </ul>
