  <li>Watch: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZXItTIjC0Wk">11 Visual Hierarchy Principles</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2isRzoZisjBS6PaGWTDV0Q">Visme</a> (many of their videos are about their proprietary presentation slide builder)</li>
  <li>Find an example of print design in your immediate(ish) area (home, office, vehicle, etc) that you love, hate or wouldn‚Äôt normally notice. You will be discussing your find in a group of 3 or 4 tomorrow.</li>
  <li>Decide on a profile pick and update your Brightspace, GitHub, Teams, Zoom, etc.</li>

<p>While this is not a design program, that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to develop ugly web applications. In the first half of DSGN 270, we will cover fundamental design principles that will (hopefully) make your applications stand out in a crowd.</p>

<h2 id="2-what-is-design">2. What is Design?</h2>
<p>Tony‚Äôs very general definition of art:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Art</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A process of creation that converts information (e.g. clay) into meaning (e.g. sculpture). Great art creates hidden meaning.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Tony‚Äôs very general definition of design:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Design</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A process that <strong>solves a problem</strong> by extracting meaning (e.g. page heading) from information (e.g. text). Great design is intuitive.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</p>

    <h2 id="visual-hierarchy">3. Visual Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>In the context of print and graphic design, visual hierarchy is one of many tools that help the viewer find meaning from a ‚Äúpage‚Äù (e.g. resume, web page, business card, etc).</p>

    <p>See: <a href="/cheatsheets/design/visual-hierarchy">Visual Hierarchy Cheatsheet</a></p>

    <h3 id="breakout-activity-2">Breakout Activity 2</h3>
    <p>In groups of 3 or 4, explore the concept of visual hierarchy in the print design industry.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You found an example of print design. How does it use (or not use) visual hierarchy? What changes would you make?</li>
      <li>What other media of print/graphic design are there? Do the same visual hierarchy principles apply equally from one medium to another?</li>
      <li>Which of your favourite websites makes the best use of visual hierarchy?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Summarize your findings and elect a representative to share them with the rest of the class.</p>
