  <li>50 years following the end of that calendar year.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, protection will expire on December 31st of the 50th year after the author dies. <em>If a corporation is the author, copyright lasts for 50 years after publication.</em></p>

<h2 id="copyright-mark">Copyright Mark</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Marking a work with the copyright symbol is not mandatory under Canadian copyright law but some other countries do require it.</li>

<ul>
  <li>50 years after publication if it was subject to Crown Copyright;</li>
  <li>50 years after the death of its creator (on Dec 31st);</li>
  <li>50 years after publication where the creator is unknown, or (if not published) 75 years after its creation;</li>
  <li>at the discretion of the creator.</li>
