## Software Setup

You will be responsible for maintaining your development environment for each course in this program. The specific requirements will change from course to course but the following software will be required for the entire program.

---

### Video
We will be running most meetings in Zoom for this program. 

- [Install Zoom](https://zoom.us/download)
- [Create Zoom Account](https://zoom.us/signup)

All participants will need to be signed in to take part in the daily streams.

---

### Messaging Apps
Slack is the preferred messaging tool for this program. You should see an invite to the SAIT WBDV Slack team sometime during orientation day.

- [Install Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/)
- Send an email to Tony (tony.grimes@sait.ca) from the email address you'd like your Slack invite sent to. Keep in mind that your SAIT email will eventually be retired after graduation.
- Tutorials: [Slack 101](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/resources/slack-101)

Note: The past two cohorts of this program also have access to this Slack team but each cohort has a private channel. Most of our communication will be in this channel but you're free to meet and interact with past students of this program. You may also use MS Teams if you'd like to avoid outside students. 

Tony also runs a public Discord server where you can find help from local developers:

## Development Browser
Regardless of which browser you prefer in your off-time, this course requires Firefox Developer for its superior (for the moment) CSS Dev Tools. Chrome can be optionally used for its Javascript Dev Tools in CPNT 262.

- [Install Firefox Developer Edition](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) (and regular FF if you haven't)

The Mozilla Developer Network (the makers of Firefox) recently launched an entire [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh5UlGiu9d6LegIeUCW4N1w) to teach developers how to use Firefox Dev Tools.

---

## Code Editor
Most of your time in this course will be spent in your code editor of choice. If you haven't installed one yet, VS Code is the current inudstry favourite.

- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you've been using one you like, stick with it, just as long as it doesn't get in the way of your learning. The old industry favourite was [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and a few past WBDV grads enjoyed [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

---

## Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) will be a large component of this program starting with CPNT 201. We will use Git to manage, share and deploy our code. It is the defacto industry standard for source code control.

- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Unfortunately, the install page isn't very user friendly. If in doubt, both Mac and Windows users can install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). We will configure Git next week!

---

### GitHub
GitHub is a private corporation (now owned by Microsoft) that has built a world-leading community around Git. All sample code and projects will be hosted by GH and the program website is hosted using [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you haven't already. **Don't forget:** your GH username will be seen by potential employers.
2. _Watch_ and/or _Star_ the [program repository](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/sait-wbdv.github.io).
