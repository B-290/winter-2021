CPNT 201 is all about the tools that we use to support our (soon to be) coding addiction. It's a course that is spread out over the program in four parts:

1. **Starting Today**: Git and Github (mostly tomorrow)
2. **Feb 3**: Raster Image software (i.e. Photoshop, in the before times)
3. **Feb 8**: Vector Image software (i.e. Illustrator, in the before times)
4. **Mar 2**: Build Tools (Sass, minification)

Today we'll be covering the core skills we'll need to use Git and GH effectively.
