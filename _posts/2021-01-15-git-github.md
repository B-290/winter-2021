See: [Terminology]({{site.baseurl}}/cheatsheets/git-gh/#terms)

## Starting project
Find a project in [sample-code] (or use one of your own) that is a static website with an `index.html` file in the root directory. You can use this as a sample project for the below exercises.

## Complete the following
1. [First Time Setup]({{site.baseurl}}/cheatsheets/git-gh/setup)
2. [Cloning a read-only repo]({{site.baseurl}}/cheatsheets/git-gh/read-only-repo)
3. [Initializing a new local repo]({{site.baseurl}}/cheatsheets/git-gh/init-local)
4. [Committing changes to a local repo]({{site.baseurl}}/cheatsheets/git-gh/add-commit)
5. [Create and sync a remote repo]({{site.baseurl}}/cheatsheets/git-gh/sync-remote)
6. [Push commits to a remote repo]({{site.baseurl}}/cheatsheets/git-gh/push-remote)

## End of day goal: Publish a website to GitHub Pages
Once you've completed the above steps and pushed a static website to GitHub, try publishing it on GH Pages.

### Prerequisites
- Remote repo with an `index.html` in the root directory.
- If you're publishing your user website (i.e. not one of your repos) your repo must be named `<username>.github.io`.

### Enabling GH Pages
1. Go to the Settings tab of the repo.
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
3. Select Source as `main` (it's sometimes `master`) and `/root`.
4. Save your changes.
5. Wait a few minutes and your website should be live at `<username>.github.io/<repo-name>` (or just `<username>.github.io` if it's your user site).

Paste your published site in `#winter-2021` and you can go hoooooome at lunch!
