## 1. Performance
### Learning Objectives
- Define First Contentful Paint (FCP).
- Define First Meaningful Paint (FMP).

- Locate the Audit tab in Chrome Developer Tools.
- Profile a website using the Audit tab in Dev Tools.

### Terminology
First Contentful Paint (FCP)
: The first content that is rendered on the screen when users browse the website. It measures the time from navigation to the time when the browser renders the first piece of content defined in the Document Object Model (DOM). This can be text, an image or canvas render.

First Meaningful Paint (FMP)
: The primary content of the page is visible. After the first meaningful paint render, it gives meaningful information to the users.

### Materials

> "Whenever you are testing your website on speed testing tools such as Googleâ€™s PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix.com you see the result with First Contentful Paint and First Meaningful Paint along with other speed metrics. These are important user-centric metrics that can tell you a lot about how long your visitors are waiting for content."
