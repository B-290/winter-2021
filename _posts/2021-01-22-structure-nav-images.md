## 2. Clickable links in a vertical navigation
### Learning Objectives
- Use a child combination selector to target elements inside a `nav` element. 
- Remove the default styles of an unordered list.
- Modify links to look like navigation buttons.
- Use `padding` to increase the clickable area of a navigation link.
- Use the `display` property to change the default behaviour of inline and block elements.

### Materials
- Starter Code: See the _Test your skills_ code above
- Sample Code: [Basic navigation list](https://codepen.io/browsertherapy/pen/XWjwJGL)

## 3. Pseudo-selectors
### Learning Objectives
- Using the `:hover` pseudo-selector, change the presentation of a navigation link when the user hovers over it.
- Using the `:active` pseudo-selector, change the presentation of a navigation link when the user clicks on it.

## Activities
### 1. Structuring a page of content
Read and complete the following MDN _Test your skills_ activity.
- [Structuring a page of content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Structuring_a_page_of_content)

### 2. Duplicate a vertical navigation menu
Try to duplicate a navigation menu using the sample code supplied in the _Test your skills_ activity.
1. Copy and paste the navigation code into a new Codepen.
2. Reset the default padding and bullets of the link list.
3. Search for an example of a vertical navigation menu online (the navigation behind hamburger menus is often vertical) that you think you can duplicate.
    - How much `padding` needs to be added to the `a` element?
    - What colours are used? How do you find this information? What elements are the colours applied to?
    - What other design elements are needed? What CSS properties are needed to create them?
