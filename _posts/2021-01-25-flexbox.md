# Terms
Flex container
: An element with `display: flex` which creates a "flex context" for its items.

Flex item
: All direct children of the Flex container. Often selected with a child selector such as `.container > *`.

---

## 1. Flexbox: Containers and items
Flexbox and CSS Grid both rely on the container/item HTML structure. With navigation, a `ul` usually serves as the container with its `li` children serving as the items.

```html
<ul class="container">
  <!-- Items: all direct children of the container -->
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
```

Additionally, the primary navigation of a page should be wrapped in a `nav` element.

## 2. Horizontal Navigation: To grow or not to grow
Yesterday, we styled a vertical navigation menu:
- Gist: [Resetting default list styles](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/54743952224fcc62435604e7d92e3795)
- Gist: [Vertical nav menu](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/245125d3886af8ff7a392a18813fb06a)

Today we'll build on this menu by making it a horizontal flexbox. We'll cover two common patterns:
- [Horizontal menu - items shrink wrap the links](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/7d270a8f7a828afe9721aa130683bff4)
- [Horizontal menu - items grow to fill extra space](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/10816649ab5d19c607c8a36690f7f2fe)

## 3. Simple banners with Flexbox
Flexbox doesn't care what elements are Flex items; if it's a direct child of a Flex container, it becomes a Flex item. In the following two examples, Flexbox uses `header` as a Flex container to control banner layouts.
- Gist: [Horizontal banner with logo and site title](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/1ff8aabed305f862c10f1ff6b8908a04)
  - This container has two Flex items: an `img` (logo) and `h1` (site title)
- Gist: [Header: Horizontal banner with logo, site title and sub-title](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/01415edde8f9405f32d3e5bc19fb25f9)
  - This example is similar to the first, except a site title and sub-title are wrapped in a `div`. This "protects" the headings from becoming Flex items (the `div` becomes the Flex item) so they will act as regular `block` elements.

## 4. Pro-tip: Use HSL to ensure readable links
The above examples use [CSS colour names](https://www.google.com/search?q=css+colour+names) to define base, hover and active states. HSL allows you to choose your colours based on Hue, Saturation and Lightness.

```css
nav a {
  color: hsl(270deg, 100%, 50%);
  background: hsl(270deg, 100%, 100%);
}

nav a:hover {
  background: hsl(60deg, 10%, 50%);
}

nav a:active {
  background: hsl(270deg, 100%, 50%);
  color: hsl(270deg, 100%, 100%);
}
```

## Activities
### 1. Flexbox practice
Read and complete the following MDN _Test your skills_ activity.
- [Flexbox layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox_skills)
  - Today's lessons covered [Flex Layout One](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox_skills#flex_layout_one). We'll cover the other layouts throughout Week 3.

### 2. Make your own horizontal nav menu
Try to duplicate a horizontal navigation menu and banner using the above sample code.

Search for an example of a horizontal navigation menu online that you think you can duplicate.
- Which of the "horizontal menu" examples above best fit your selected menu? Are other Flexbox properties required to achieve the desired effect?
- How much `padding` needs to be added to the `a` element?
- What colours are used? How do you find this information? What elements are the colours applied to?
- What other design elements are needed? What CSS properties are needed to create them?
