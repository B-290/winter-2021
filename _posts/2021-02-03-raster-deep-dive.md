## Lecture/Live code
### Learning Objectives
1. Define image encoder.
2. Distinguish between lossless, lossy compression.
3. Distinguish between high and low frequency imagery.
4. Predict whether lossless or lossy compression will be best for a particular image.

### Terminology
<dl>
Image encoder
: A library/module that converts one image format to another. Not all encoders are created equal.

High Frequency Imagery
: Parts of an image (or the whole image) where colour and contrast change a lot from one pixel to the next. Example: a photo of a busy intersection.

Low Frequency Imagery
: Parts of an image (or the whole image) where colour and contrast change very little from one pixel to the next. Example: a vector logo or other image with a lot of flat colour.

Colour Data
: The digital information in an image that controls pixel colour. Also called chroma data.

Brightness Data
: The digital information in an image that controls pixel brightness.
