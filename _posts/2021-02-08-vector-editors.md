## Homework
1. Prep
    1. Go to Tony's [Band Name Generator](https://acidtone.github.io/namor/) and click for a new combination of words until you find a new product that a startup (either yours or a potential client) might think is the "next big thing".
    2. Based on the phrase you've chosen, find one or more [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons (or similar) that you can use to create a quick company/product logo for your startup.
        - Example: [Tony's Browser Therapy Logo](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/sample-code/assets/images/logos/browser-therapy.svg)
    3. Download the SVG versions of your icons so you can import them into Figma for the lesson.
2. Figma
    - Reference: [Figma Tutorial Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4)

## Vector Theory
### Learning Objectives
1. Distinguish the difference between raster and vector image formats.
2. 

### Terminology

Vector Graphics
: Instead of being defined in pixels like raster images, vector graphics are defined with math like fonts (and icon fonts). This means that vector images always look sharp because the browser can re-draw it at any size and they are usually a much smaller file size than images defined with pixels.

Anchor Point
: A single point located on a page/artboard/viewport that a path can pass through.

Path
: A straight or curved line that connects two anchor points.

Closed Shape
: A shape that is enclosed from all sides, end-to-end, forming a figure with no openings. Examples: circle, triangle, square, polygon, etc.

Fill
: The SVG version of `background-color`.

Stroke
: The SVG version of `border`.

### Materials
