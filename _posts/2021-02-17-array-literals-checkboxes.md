## 1. Array Overview
### Learning Objectives
- Create an array using an array literal.
- Add to the end of an array using `[]`.
- Access an item in an array using the item's index.
- Re-assign an item in an array using the item's index.

### Terminology
Array literal
: A comma separated list of values surrounded by `[]`. For example, ['cats', 'dogs', 'fish'].

Array index
: The location of an item in an array. In Javascript, his is always a sequential number starting at 0.

### Materials
- MDN: [Common array operations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#common_operations)

### Key Takeaways
- Array indexes _always_ start at zero and increase by one with each additional element.
- The _next_ index in an array is _always_ `array.length`.
- The _last_ index of an array is _always_ `array.length - 1`.
- The _value_ of an element can be any data type: `undefined`, `null`, `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`, etc.
- Although arrays can be a list of any value type, you rarely see a mix of types in the same array.
- The most common use case of an array is a list of objects, which we'll cover later this week.
- Don't forget: creating an array using `const` still allows you to change (or mutate) the items in that array.

## 2. Finding a random item in an array
### Learning Objectives
- Create a random index of an array.
- Retrieve a random item from an array.

### Materials
- Gist: [Find a Random Item in an Array](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/2a3cac26a229aa95685e5cf6344f2e4e)

### Key Takeaways
- Random numbers in Javascript are a pain.
