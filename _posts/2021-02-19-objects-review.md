## 1. Object fundamentals
### Learning Objectives
- Explore the different ways to [initialize objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer).
- Access a property in an object using dot notation.
- Re-assign an item in an object using dot notation.

### Terminology
Object
: A collection of name/value pairs (in terms of Javascript)

Object Literal
: An object _literally_ coded using proper object notation.

Object Property
: A fancy term for a name/value pair where the _value_ is anything but a function.

Object Method
: A fancy term for name/value pair where the _value_ is a function.

### Materials
- MDN Guide: [Working_with_Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)

### Key Takeaways
- Much like flexboxes and grids, arrays and objects can be nested inside each other.
- Object properties are for nouns, methods (aka. functions) are for verbs.

## 2. Course Review
### Learning Objectives
- Revisit the relationship between the Javascript runtime and the environment it runs in.
  - DOM things (example: `document`.things)
  - Core modules (example: `Math`.things)
- Revisit the Javascript data types covered until this point.
  - primitive types
    - `undefined`
    - `null`
    - `number`
    - `string`
    - `boolean`
  - complex types
    - `array`
    - `object`
  - structures
    - conditional statements
- Build a literal JS object of a thing of your choice. Incorporate each of the following data types:
  - `number`
  - `string`
  - `array`
  - nested `object`
  - `null`
- Use a conditional statement to output a message (either to the console or an HTML page) that changes based on your object properties.

### Materials
