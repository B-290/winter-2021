2. JSON
    - Read: [Working with JSON data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
    - Tool: [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
3. `fetch()`
    - Read: [Fetching data from the server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Fetching_data)
    - Read: [How to use Fetch API for CRUD operations](https://dev.to/duhbhavesh/how-to-use-fetch-api-for-crud-operations-57a0) on dev.to
    - Reference: [Create, read, update and delete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) on Wikipedia

## Morning reflection
### Housekeeping

---

## 1. FizzBuzz walkthrough
### Learning Objectives
- Review conditional statements: `if`/`else`/`else if`.
- Review arithmetic operators.
- Test if a value is an integer.

### Materials
- Gist: [Print 1-to-100 with a for Loop](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/e87aa5564ae1b286beca66b07d52550f)

### Key Takeaways
- There are usually many ways to solve a problem.

## 2. Functions as methods
### Learning Objectives
- Review object literals and how to initialize objects.
- Create an object method using an object literal and function expressions.
- Create an object method using dot notation and function expressions.
- Understand `this` in the context of objects.

### Terminology
Object
: A collection of name/value pairs (in terms of Javascript)

Object Literal
: An object _literally_ coded using proper object notation.

Object Property
: A fancy term for a name/value pair where the _value_ is anything but a function.

Object Method
: A fancy term for name/value pair where the _value_ is a function.

`this` (for methods)
: When inside a method (a function that's the property of an object), `this` is a keyword that refers to the parent object.

### Materials
- Starter: [Greeter](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/in-class/tree/main/w7f/1-greeter-starter)

### Key Takeaways
- Avoid the use of `this` unless you're working within a method (and not even inside a function inside a method). Outside of a method, [`this` is a big bag of hurt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this).
