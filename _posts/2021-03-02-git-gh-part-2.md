    - Read: [How to make your first pull request on GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)
2. Git
    - [Ignoring Files](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/ignoring-files) on GitHub Docs

## 1. Ignoring files in Git
### Learning Objectives
- Ignore files in a Git repo using a project `.gitignore` file.
- Ignore files in all Git repos using a global `.gitignore` file.

### Materials
- [Sample Code `.gitignore` file](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/sample-code/blob/master/.gitignore)
- Gist: [Setting up a global `.gitignore` file](https://gist.github.com/subfuzion/db7f57fff2fb6998a16c)

### Key Takeaways
- It's considered bad practice to include system level files to your project `.gitignore` files. These should go into a global `.gitignore` file. Examples:

    ```
    # Mac
    .DS_Store
    .Spotlight-V100
    .Trashes

    # Windows
    Thumbs.db
    desktop.ini

    # vi
    *~

    # General
    log/
    *.log
    ```
- For the purposes of CPNT 262, it's important that we ignore the following project files and directories (in addition to the system files above):

    ```
    # dotenv environment variables file
    .env
    .env.test

    # Dependency directories
    node_modules
    ```

## 2. Merge conflicts
### Learning Objectives
- Recognize when a merge conflict occurs.
- Understand what causes a merge conflict.
- Create a merge conflict in a new repo using the GitHub web interface.
- Resolve a merge conflict using VS Code.
- Recognize the difference between a normal commit and a merge commit on GitHub, based on the number of parent branches listed.

### Terminology
Merge
: When two branches in Git are merged into one. This will often happen if two developers are submitted code to a project or one developer is submitting code from two machines.

Merge conflict
: When two branches edit the same line of code. Git doesn't know which change to keep so it leaves it to the developer to decide when remote code is pulled.

Current Change
: The change (relevant to the conflict) that was made on the local repo.

Incoming Change
: The change that is incoming from the remote repo.

### Materials
- Activity: [Create a merge conflict](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/d8c2e285c9b25fcb7443a4f0f4e4b4e6)

### Key Takeaways
- Push code often. When two developers edit the same line of code, the dev that pushed their code last is the one that has to resolve the conflict.
- It's sometimes not obvious: after you accept the current/incoming change, you still need to `add` and `commit` the changes.

## 2. Pull requests
### Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between forking and cloning a repository.
- Create a new Issue in a public repo.
- Fork a repo to your GH account.
- Clone a forked repo to your local machine.
- Create a branch of a forked repo.
  - Commit changes to a branch.
  - Push commits to remote branch.
- Create a Pull Request based on a branch of a forked repo.

### Terminology
Fork a repository
: A GitHub feature - when a 3rd party repo is copied to your GitHub account, including the entire commit history. 

Pull request
: A Github feature - when a person requests to contribute code to a repo they do not have write privileges for.

### Materials
- [How to make your first pull request on GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)
- Pull Request Directories
  - [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
  - [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)
  - [Another Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissues.com/)
  - [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
  - [Pull Request Roulette](http://www.pullrequestroulette.com/)
  - [Contrib](https://gauger.io/contrib/#/language/javascript) (JavaScript)
  - [Up for Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)

### Key Takeaways
- `clone` is a Git feature, whereas forking a repo is a GitHub only feature that facilitates contributions from users that don't have write access on a repo.
- Submitting a Pull Request still needs to be accepted, which is out of your control.

## Open lab-time
1. Git collaboration practice: Nominate a repo owner from your breakout group and:
    1. Have the owner create a public repo with a default README;
    2. Have the owner add the group members as collaborators;
    3. Each collaborator clones the repo to their local machines;
    4. Pick a single line that each group member will try to edit;
    5. Race: who can `add`, `commit` and `push` their changes to that line of code before anyone else? Everyone else will have to deal with the merge conflicts.

### Tony's goals for Lab-Time
- Gist for "git collaboration practice"
